- 👋 Hi, I’m @funkcole8
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, especially when it comes to data processing to solve daily problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything relevant to my current projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything
- 📫 How to reach me funkcole8@gmail.com
- My previous projects (not uploaded): 
-   polynomial creation (specify order and what values are allowed as roots such as integers and fractions)
-   factoring polynomials into first order binomials (works for real integer and fraction roots) 
-   collatz theorem tester (goes through numbers from a given start to determine if the collatz theorem works for them)
-   math speed test builder (specify type of problem such as add subtract multiply divide, types of numbers allowed, and size of numbers allowed then it prints enough practice problems to fit on a page)
-   population genetics to display gene persistence (given number of genes, starting frequency, and survival rates of each it will predict future percentages of the genes)
-   extraction of college info (collects data from website sourcecode about colleges on a specific website and inputs them into an excel sheet)
-   Titration calculator (creates graph of pH to volume added during titration when given starting concentrations of the two solutions and the pKa's of the compound they contain)
-   square root estimator (creates a graph showing the percent error of a method used to algebraically estimate square roots)
-   logarithm estimator (creates a graph showing the percent error of a method used to algebraically estimate logarithms)
-   protease simulator (simulates a protease by cutting protein at specific amino acid residues and creates all possible pieces. Then gives molecular weights, compares to experimentally obtained weights to predict which fragments are the likely ones produced and outputs them in a file)
-   choices (picks a random option out options provided, selects multiple if desired)
-   tiles and surveyors (calculates the optimal number of surveyors to buy based on current price of tile from the game "territory idle")
-   A few small games (less than ten minute playthrough) in Unity
-   Several small VB desktop apps
- My programming languages:
-   Primary: Python
-   Secondary: C#, VB
-   Others I've tried but never used for a project: Java, HTML, C, Assembly
-
